This code takes first line input as an integer which is the number of test cases need to be passed.
The subsequent lines are the inputs given to the program.
Each input taken as an integer compares with the fibonacci series and add those numbers in fibonacci series
which are equal to or less than the given input and which is also even and would print the final sum.
